# CommunityShare_GNIT
 Project CommunityShare  it is a platform designed to facilitate the sharing of resources within local communities. Users can post items or services they have available for others to use or request items or services they need. This fosters a sense of community, encourages sustainable practices, and helps individuals save money by borrowing instead of buying.
